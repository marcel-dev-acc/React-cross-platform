# React Cross Platform

## Introduction

Having closely followed the evolution of both frameworks, I am excited to present an innovative solution that combines the power of React and React Native into a unified repository.

In today's fast-paced development landscape, building applications that cater to multiple platforms is essential for reaching a wider audience. React has revolutionized web development by providing a declarative and component-based approach, while React Native has enabled the creation of native mobile applications using JavaScript. However, managing separate codebases for web and mobile platforms can lead to redundant efforts, code duplication, and maintenance challenges.

Recognizing this need for efficiency and code reusability, I have conceptualized a solution that merges React and React Native projects into a single repository. By consolidating these frameworks, we can leverage the shared logic and components between web and mobile applications, reducing development time and enhancing consistency across platforms.

With this integrated approach, we can streamline the development process by writing common components that seamlessly adapt to both web and native mobile platforms. This not only ensures a consistent user experience but also accelerates the iteration and deployment cycles for new features or updates. By leveraging the extensive ecosystem of both React and React Native, we can tap into a vast array of libraries, tools, and resources, providing a solid foundation for building robust and performant applications.

Furthermore, this unified repository approach empowers the development team to work collaboratively, fostering knowledge sharing and cross-pollination of ideas. By eliminating the need to switch between separate projects, developers can focus their efforts on enhancing the shared components, refining the application's architecture, and delivering high-quality code.

## Implementation

I have implemented a Button component for both web and native platforms in this project as an example. To cater to the specific requirements of each platform, I have organized the code into separate files: __Button.tsx__ for the web platform and __Button.native.tsx__ for the native mobile platforms.

To handle the resolution of the appropriate import based on the platform, I've created an __index.tsx__ file. This file serves as the entry point for importing the Button component and automatically determines the correct import based on how the application is run.

When I run the application using `npm run web`, the __index.tsx__ file intelligently imports and utilizes the Button component from __Button.tsx__. This ensures that the web-specific implementation is used when the application is running on web platforms.

Similarly, when I run the application using `npm run android` or `npm run ios`, the __index.tsx__ file imports and employs the Button component from __Button.native.tsx__. This guarantees that the native-specific implementation is used when the application is running on Android or iOS platforms.

The reason the above works is due to the order of importance when importing files. In React Native the *.native.tsx file extension takes precedence over the standard *.tsx file import. For this reason the __index.tsx__ resolves to *.native.tsx before attempting to find another file with the same name. The same applies for *.native.android.tsx or *.native.ios.tsx.
